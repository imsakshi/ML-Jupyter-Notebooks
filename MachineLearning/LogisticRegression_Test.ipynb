It’s an S-shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between 0 and 1, but never exactly at those limits.\n",

    "Logistic regression is a linear method, but the predictions are transformed using the logistic function. The impact of this is that we can no longer understand the predictions as a linear combination of the inputs as we can with linear regression, for example, continuing on from above, the model can be stated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "p(X) = e^(b0 + b1*X) / (1 + e^(b0 + b1*X))\n",
    "\n",
    "I don’t want to dive into the math too much, but we can turn around the above equation as follows (remember we can remove the e from one side by adding a natural logarithm (ln) to the other):\n",
    "\n",
    "ln(p(X) / 1 – p(X)) = b0 + b1 * X\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful because we can see that the calculation of the output on the right is linear again (just like linear regression), and the input on the left is a log of the probability of the default class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ratio on the left is called the odds of the default class (it’s historical that we use odds, for example, odds are used in horse racing rather than probabilities). Odds are calculated as a ratio of the probability of the event divided by the probability of not the event, e.g. 0.8/(1-0.8) which has the odds of 4. So we could instead write:\n",
    "\n",
    "ln(odds) = b0 + b1 * X\n",

    "Because the odds are log transformed, we call this left hand side the log-odds or the probit. It is possible to use other types of functions for the transform (which is out of scope_, but as such it is common to refer to the transform that relates the linear regression equation to the probabilities as the link function, e.g. the probit link function.\n",
